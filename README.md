# Surrealist-User-Interaction (Introduction to Computing: Lab 3)
In this lab, I recreated an example of surrealism using JavaScript. When the user clicks in the middle of the eye (the pupil), 
the piece becomes truly surrealist by changing the iris into a sky filled with clouds.

My work was later combined with that of my classmate Ryan Hunter
which featured a blimp made out of a lemon that drops seeds and moves from left to right when clicked on in one of my projects. 
The project (project 2, which is also on my profile) basically just integrates our separate pieces together 
while still maintaining the location in which the user clicks to change the scene.

Within this repository, you will find a demo video attached. Enjoy!
